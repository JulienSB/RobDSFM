** Robust Dynamic Semiparametric Factor Model (DSFM) for fMRI data**

Statistical inference and latent variable modeling for fMRI data.

## Contents and usage

The present repository contains the software used to estimate DSFM models with non-robust and robust methods on fMRI data, 
as it is performed in the paper "Robust sieve M-estimation with an application to dimensionality reduction".
Please note that the software is designed for use on MATLAB and uses spm12 to download the data.
The following subsections detail the installation and use of the software.
Notice also that the package uses and contains subroutines in R.
