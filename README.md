**Robust Dynamic Semiparametric Factor Model (DSFM) for fMRI data**

Statistical inference and latent variable modeling for fMRI data.

## Contents and usage

The present repository contains the software used to estimate DSFM models with non-robust and robust methods on fMRI data, 
as it is performed in the paper "Robust sieve M-estimation with an application to dimensionality reduction".
Please note that the software is designed for use on MATLAB. 
Notice that the function compute_splines.m implicitly makes use of R.
Therefore, if you do not have R, you can either unzip the folder provided and add it to in your matlab path
download R from R-Cran, and install the required packages.
The following subsections detail the installation and use of the software.
